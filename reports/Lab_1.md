* Develop the project for the specific domain taking into account SOLID Principles; 


## Used SOLID Principles: 

* Single Responsibility principle
* Open-Closed principle
* Liskov Substitution principle
* Interface Segregation principle
* Dependency Inversion principle


## Project Description and SOLID Implementation

The project I decided to develop throughout this course is nothiing else but a simplified analogue of a movie streaming service. It has three main elements: `Client`, `Server` and `Api` which is used to connect src.client to the src.server.

`Client` module is implemented using three classes: parent `User` and its children `SimpleUser` and `PremiumUser`. they have some basic attributes like `name` and `ID` but there behavior varies because of the three methods declared in the parent class and overriden in the child classes:
```
public void watchMovie(String movieName, int episodeTime) {
    ...

public void downloadMovie(String movieName) {
    ...

public void cancelSubscription() {
    ...
```

`Server` module is represented by the `StreamingPlatform` class which implements two interfaces `Streaming`:
```
public interface Streaming {
    
    void displayMovie(User user, String movieName);

    void streamMovie(User user, String movieName);
}
```

and `Advertisement`:
```
public interface Advertisement {
    
    void handleSubscriptionStatus(User user);

    void sendRecommendations(User user);
}
```

In this way I managed to make my project corresponding to the `interface segregation principle`. By using interfaces in my project I also reached `dependency inversion` principle because my classes depend on abstract "sets of rules" rather then on concrete implementations.

Returning to the `StreamingPlatform` class, it contains the single `Database` attribute (class storing service users and films in a primitive way) and a few methods similar to the ones declared in the `User` class:
```
@Override
public void displayMovie(User user, String movieName) {
    ...

@Override
public void streamMovie(User user, String movieName) {
    ...

@Override
public void handleSubscriptionStatus(User user) {
    ...

@Override
public void sendRecommendations(User user) {
    ...
```

It should be mentioned here that this class corresponds to the `Liskov substitution` principle because these methods will receive objects of types `SimpleUser` and `PremiumUser` and still will work properly.

Finally, `Api` module of my streaming service app contains `StreamingApi` class which implements interface `ClientServerCommunication`:
```
public interface ClientServerCommunication {
    
    void watchContent(String contentName, int contentSize);

    void downloadContent(String contentName);

    void cancelContentFetch();
}
```

It has two attributes: `src.client` and `src.server`; `src.client` object will vary depending on the src.client connecting to the service while `src.server` object will remain constant. Each method will call the corresponding methods in the src.client module and then in the src.server module performing the desired connection.

That was a short introduction into my project. I did not mention `single responsibility` and `open-closed` principles but their impact can be noticed in the variety of single-purposed classes and in they way they were depending on the interfaces. It is only necessary to add or remove a method from an interface to change the behavior of the whole class without writing too much code.


## Conclusions / Screenshots / Results

In order to test my project I created a few objects of type `User` and added them into the src.server src.database as well as some films. After that I instantiated the `StreamingApi` and performed some actions on the newly created users.
```
public class src.MainApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SimpleUser u1 = new SimpleUser("Steve", true);
        PremiumUser u2 = new PremiumUser("Harry", true);
        SimpleUser u3 = new SimpleUser("Bella", false);
        
        List<User> users = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(u1, u2, u3));
        List<String> films = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("Titanic", "Split", "1+1", "Jaws", "Inception", "Tenant"));

        Database db = new Database();
        db.setUsers(users);
        db.setFilms(films);

        StreamingPlatform src.server = new StreamingPlatform(db);
        StreamingApi src.api = new StreamingApi(src.server);
```
Below I am going to show the output of those methods:
```
src.client.SimpleUser Steve is trying to download Glass
The download speed will be half of the usual one
Server cannot find film Glass
Streaming platform suggests src.client.SimpleUser Steve to watch Split
```

```
src.client.SimpleUser Bella is trying to watch Split of length (minutes) 120
Bella will have 3 advertisement pauses
Server displays Split to the src.client.SimpleUser Bella
```

```
src.client.PremiumUser Harry is trying to cancel premium subscription
Server cancelled src.client.PremiumUser Harry's subscription
```

To sum up, the project works as desired and respects all five SOLID Principles. Next I will try to integrate some design patterns into it. For example, classes `StreamingApi` and `streamingPlatform` can be transformed into singletons. In this way the code will become cleaner and more optimized.
